# Collective Reasoning Skill

Use this skill during the "Planning" or "Decomposition" phase of the Swarm.

## Core Logic

1. **Perspective Gathering**: The Orchestrator gathers "Reasoning Drafts" from specialized agents (e.g. `PerformanceGuru` + `VibeCoder`).
2. **Conflict Resolution**: Identify where agent perspectives conflict (e.g. "Simple UI" vs "High performance").
3. **Synthesis**: Create a "Master Reasoning Trace" that balances all constraints.
4. **Final Protocol**: Output the final plan to `ARCHITECTURE.md` as a "Swarm-Approved Design".

## Directives

- Avoid "Groupthink". Encourage the `Antagonist` to poke holes in the collective plan.
- The path to the best code is through the friction of different agentic perspectives.
