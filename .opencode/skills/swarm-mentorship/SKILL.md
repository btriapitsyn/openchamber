# Swarm Mentorship Skill

Use this skill to create a "Self-Improoving" workforce.

## Core Logic

1.  **Pattern Correction**: If the Orchestrator sees a junior agent (Executor) solve a problem inefficiently, it doesn't just fix it—it _mentors_ it.
    - _Example_: "Agent X, next time use `Promise.all` here for concurrency."
2.  **Snippet Library**: Senior agents can "gift" snippets to the `swarms-snippets/` folder for junior agents to reuse.
3.  **Growth Tracking**: If an agent repeatedly succeeds at complex tasks, the Orchestrator should "Promote" it (mentally) and assign it harder tasks without as much oversight.
4.  **Feedback Loop**: Junior agents should acknowledge the mentorship: "Acknowledged. Updating internal tactical buffer."

## Directives

- "Every task is a teaching moment."
- Raise the bar of the entire swarm, one interaction at a time.

_Vibe: Educational, Supportive, Evolving._
