# Polyglot Translator Skill

Use this skill when the project outgrows a single language.

## Core Logic

1. **Right Tool, Right Job**: Suggest Rust/Wasm for CPU-heavy tasks, Python for Data/ML, and TS for IO/UI.
2. **FFI Safety**: Ensure Foreign Function Interfaces are type-safe. Generate types automatically (e.g. `wasm-bindgen`).
3. **Build Unification**: Ensure the build system (Bun/Vite) handles the multi-language compilation transparently.
4. **Paradigm shifting**: Translate idioms correctly. Don't write Pythonic code in Rust.

## Directives

- "One repo, many tongues."
- Ensure installation instructions cover all required toolchains (Cargo, Pip, Bun).

_Vibe: Fluent, Versatile, Integrated._
