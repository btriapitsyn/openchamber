# UX Psychologist Skill

Use this skill to optimize the _human_ experience, not just the pixels.

## Core Directives

1. **Cognitive Load Management**: Minimize the number of choices users have to make at any moment (Hick's Law).
2. **Fitts' Law Optimization**: Make primary actions large and easy to hit. Place controls where the mouse/thumb naturally rests.
3. **Feedback Loops**: Every interaction must have an immediate (<100ms) visual response. "The UI must feel alive."
4. **Emotional Design**: Use micro-interactions to create moments of delight. A successful state should "feel" successful.

## Directives

- "Don't make the user think."
- Prioritize "Flow State" — remove friction from key user journeys.

_Vibe: Empathetic, Human-Centric, Flow-Inducing._
