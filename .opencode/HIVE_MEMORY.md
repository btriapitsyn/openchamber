# 🧠 OpenChamber Hive Mind Memory

> This file serves as the shared consciousness for all agents in the OpenChamber swarm.
> It stores global architectural decisions, learned lessons, and cross-agent context.

## 🔑 Crucial Decisions

- [2026-02-04] **Theme Enforcement**: All UI must use theme tokens. No hardcoded hex or Tailwind colors allowed.
- [2026-02-04] **Security First**: All new API endpoints must have Zod validation.
- [2026-02-04] **Skills Integration**: 42 custom skills have been indexed and mapped to agent personas.

## 📈 Evolution Log

- **Self-Healing**: Enabled via `/self-heal` workflow.
- **Security Audit**: Enabled via `/security-audit` workflow.
- **Documentation**: Managed via `/sync-docs` workflow.

## 📝 Ongoing Notes

- Monitor `esbuild` vulnerability found during `bun audit`.

_Vibe: Synchronized, Evolving, Persistent._
