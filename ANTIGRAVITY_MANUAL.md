## 🦅 The Agents

### 1. SwarmOrchestrator (The Commander)

- **Role**: Strategic planning, delegation, and peace-keeping.
- **Superpowers**:
  - `strategic-foresight`: Predicts scalability issues before they happen.
  - `swarm-diplomat`: Resolves deadlocks between sub-agents.
  - `cockpit-liaison`: Maintains a hardline to the IDE Mainframe.

### 2. VibeCoder (The Executor)

- **Role**: High-velocity implementation and aesthetic perfection.
- **Superpowers**:
  - `ux-psychologist`: Optimizes UI for human cognitive flow.
  - `polyglot-translator`: Fluidly mixes Rust/Wasm/JS.
  - `cockpit-context-bridge`: "Sees" what you see (tabs, cursor).

### 3. TheAntagonist (The Security)

- **Role**: Zero-trust security auditing and red-teaming.
- **Superpowers**:
  - `security-fortress`: Supply chain hardening and threat modeling.

## 🧠 The Skills Matrix

| Skill               | Purpose                                               | Owner        |
| :------------------ | :---------------------------------------------------- | :----------- |
| **Hive Mind Sync**  | Shared consciousness via `.opencode/HIVE_MEMORY.md`.  | All Agents   |
| **Context Bridge**  | Syncs agent attention with User's IDE focus.          | All Agents   |
| **Telemetry Link**  | Streams real-time "Health" & "Confidence" to Cockpit. | Orchestrator |
| **Intent Parser**   | Decodes vague commands using environmental context.   | Orchestrator |
| **Knowledge Graph** | auto-maps code to architectural concepts.             | Orchestrator |

## 📟 How to Use

1.  **Just Ask**: "Build a secure Login flow."
    - _System Action_: Intent Parser decodes goal -> Orchestrator plans with Foresight -> Diplomat ensures Security & Vibe agree -> Code is shipped.
2.  **Collaborate**: "We need to fix this bug."
    - _System Action_: Context Bridge detects your open file -> Agent jumps to that context -> Telemetry stream shows progress.
3.  **Teach**: "Don't do X, do Y."
    - _System Action_: `swarm-mentorship` logs this lesson to the Hive Mind.

> _Welcome to the future of coding._
